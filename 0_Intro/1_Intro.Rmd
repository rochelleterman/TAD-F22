## Instructors

#### About me
My name is Rochelle Terman and I'm an Assistant Professor in Political Science. 

- My substantive research is on international norms and human rights. 
- I also have an interest in computational social science.
- I am not a methodologist.

## Core Learning Objectives

#### Ultimate Goal 

>Introduce students to modern computational text analysis techniques and provide an orientation for those wishing to go further with text analysis in their own research.

#### Proximate Goals
1. Learn about popular methods and techniques involved in modern computational text analysis.
2. Be able to collect, preprocess, and conduct useful analysis on text data.
3. Know where to go next in their pursuit of more advanced computational text methods.

---
## Topics

* String data and regular expressions
* Web APIs and webscraping
* Preprocessing texts
* Lexical diversity, complexity, readability
* Dictionary methods 
* Sentiment Analysis 
* Distinctive Words
* Text similarity / distances
* Multidimensional scaling
* K-means and hierarchical clustering
* Topic modeling
* Supervised classification
* Word and document embeddings

---
## Topics

#### This course will NOT cover...

* the technical details behind machine learning, such as optimization algorithms and theoretical properties.
* all text analysis tools, or even most of them. 
* most natural language processing


--
#### If your goal is to develop new methods, this is probably not the course for you.


---
## Prerequisites

#### Students should have

- at least one class in statistics and/or inference
- basic knowledge of probability, densities, distributions, statistical tests, hypothesis testing, the linear model, generalized linear models,  maximum likelihood.
- working knowledge of the `R` programming language.
- familiarity with how their computer works.

#### Students should NOT have

- previous classes in computational text analysis or text as data
- previous classes in machine learning

---
## Alternative courses

__To learn basic programming for social sciences:__

* Computing for Social Science (Soltoff, MACSS)

__To master the cutting edge of content analysis:__

* Computational Content Analysis (Evans, Sociology)

__To learn NLP from a computer science perspective:__

* Natural Language Processing (Tan, CS)

__To learn machine learning:__

* One of the dozens (!) of ML courses on campus

---
## Course Outline

The course is divided into three main sections: 

1. collecting and processing texts
2. supervised learning
3. unsupervised learning

---
## Course Websites

We will use __Canvas__ to:

- distribute readings
- distribute/accept assignments

We will use __Piazza__ (available through canvas) to:

- ask and answer questions
- communicate with one another

We will use __Github__ (github.com/rochelleterman/TAD-F22) to:

- distributed class notes, code, slides, etc.


---
## Course format

#### Semi flipped classroom
- 1/2 lecture, 1/2 coding in R.
- Bring your laptop, prepare to close it
- Work with a friend, especially if you’re computer isn’t working.

### Lab (Fridays, 10:30 - 11:20 AM, Cobb Hall 301)
- Led by Ari

---
## Evaluation

This is a graded class based on the following:
  - Completion of assigned homework (50%)
  - Participation (25%)
  - Final project (25%)

If you want to audit, please let me know ASAP.

---
## Assignments

* There are 4 assignments, generally due every 2 weeks.
* The first assignment is due in two weeks. 
* Turn in assignments on Canvas.
* Work in groups, but submit your own.

---
## Participation

The class participation portion of the grade can be satisfied in one or more of the following ways:

- attending the lectures,
- asking and answering questions in class,
- attending office hours,
- contributing to class discussion through Piazza,
- collaborating with the computing community.

---
## Final Project

Students have two options for class projects:

1. __Data project__: Using the tools we learned in class on your own data of interest.

2. __Tool project__: Create a tutorial on a tool we didn't cover in class. 

Students are required to write a short proposal by __November 3__ (no more than 2 paragraphs) in order to get approval / feedback from the instructors. 

In lieu of a final, we will have a **poster session** where students can present their projects.

---
## Software

* We will be using the `R` programming language.
* Installation instructions are github.
* If you have computer troubles, post the problem on the discussion forums, with as much detail as possible.

---
## 15 minute rule

We will follow the **15 minute rule** in this class. If you encounter a problem in your assignments, spend 15 minutes troubleshooting the problem on your own. Here are some tips:

- Read the errors!
- Read the documentation
- Make it smaller
- Figure out what changed
- Check your syntax
- Print statements are your friend

---
## Asking for Help

After 15 minutes, if you still cannot solve the problem, **ask for help**. 

We will use Piazza for class-related questions and discussion. You are highly encouraged to ask questions, and answer one another's questions.

1. Include a brief, informative title.
2. Explain what you're trying to do, and how it failed.
3. Include a reproducible example.

Here are some helpful guidelines on how to properly ask programming questions:

1. ["How to Ask Programming Questions," ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/how-to-ask-programming-questions)
2. ["How do I ask a good question?" StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
3. ["How to properly ask for help" Computing for Social Science](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/faq/asking-questions/)

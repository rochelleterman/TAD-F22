## What is an API?


* API stands for .accent[Application Programming Interface]

* a set of rules and procedures that facilitate interactions between computers and their applications

---
## Web APIs

* allows users to query a remote database over the internet

* take on a variety of formats 

* majority adhere to a particular style known as .accent[Representational State Transfet] or .accent[REST]

* with .accent[RESTful APIs], we query databases using special URLs 


---
## RESTful Web APIs are All Around You...

Consider a simple Google search.

```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "img/google_link.png")
```

Ever wonder what all that extra stuff in the address bar was all about?  

---
## RESTful Web APIs are All Around You...

It looks like Google makes its query by taking the search terms, separating each of them with a "`+`", and appending them to the link:

`https://www.google.com/#q=`

So that we have

`https://www.google.com/#q=search1+search2`

So can change our Google search by adding some terms to the URL.

---
## Some Basic Terminology: URL

* .accent[Uniform Resource Location]

* a string of characters that, when interpreted via the .accent[Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]

* points to a data resource, notably files written in .accent[Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)] or a subset of a database.

---
## Some Basic Terminology: HTTP Methods / Verbs

* .accent[GET]: asks for data corresponding to a particular URL. The  main method used for querying RESTful databases.

* .accent[GET request]: The process of executing the GET method.
    
* .accent[HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE]: other common methods, though mostly never used for database querying (ignore them).

---
## How Do GET Requests Work?  A Web Browsing Analogy

* Surfing the Web = Making a bunch of GET Requests

* For instance, I open my web browser and type in http://www.wikipedia.org.  Once I hit return, I'd see a webpage.

* Several different processes occurred, however, between me hitting "return" and the page finally being rendered. 

---
## Step 1: The GET Request

* web browser took the entered character string 

* used the command-line tool "Curl" to write a properly formatted HTTP GET request 

* submitted it to the server that hosts the Wikipedia homepage.

---
## STEP 2: The Response

* Wikipedia's server receives this request

* send back an HTTP response

* from which Curl extracted the HTML code for the page

```{html}
"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"mul\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<head>\n<!-- Sysops: 
Please do not edit the main template directly; update /temp and synchronise. 
-->\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<title>Wikipedia</title>\n<!--[if lt IE 7]><meta
http-equiv=\"imagetoolbar\" content=\"no\"><![endif]-->\n<meta name=\"viewport\"
content=\"i"
```

---
## STEP 3: The Formatting

* raw HTML code was formatted and executed by the web browser

* rendering the page as seen in the window.

```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "img/wikipedia.png")
```

---
## RESTful Database Querying: The GET Request

* URL we supply must be constructed so that the resulting request can be interpreted and successfully acted upon by the server.  

* Likely that the character string must encode .accent[search terms] and/or .accent[filtering parameters], as well as one or more .accent[authentication codes].  

* While the terms are often similar across APIs, most are API-specific.

---
## RESTful Database Querying: The Response

* unlike web browsing, the content of the server's response that is extracted by Curl is unlikely to be HTML code. 

* will likely be **raw text** response that can be parsed into one of a few file formats commonly used for data storage.  

* usual suspects include `.csv`, `.xml`, and `.json` files.

---
## RESTful Database Querying: The Formatting

* web browser parsed the HTML code, 

* but **we need R, Python, or other programming languages** to parse the server response 

* and convert it into a format for local storage (e.g. matrices, dataframes, databases, lists, etc.).

---
## Getting API Access

* For most APIs, a .accent[key] or other user .accent[credentials] are required
* Most APIs are set up for developers, so youâ€™ll likely be asked to register an "application"
* rate limits = total number of calls / time

#### NYT Article API
  - 10 calls per minute and 4,000 calls per day.
  - You should sleep 6 seconds between calls to avoid hitting the per minute rate limit.
  - Get an NYT API key here: https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started
  - Read documentation here: https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/routes/articlesearch.json/get

## Using APIs in R

There are two ways to collect data through APIs in R.

#### 1. Plug-n-play packages

- Common APIs are available through user-written R Packages. 
- functions that "wrap" API queries and format the response. 
- usually much more convenient than writing our own query, so it's worth searching around for a package that works with the API we need.

#### 2. Writing our own API request

- If no wrapper function is available, we have to write our own API request, and format the response ourselves using R. 
- This is trickier, but definitely do-able.

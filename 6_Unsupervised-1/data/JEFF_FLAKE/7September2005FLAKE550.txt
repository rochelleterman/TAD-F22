Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, vice-chairman of the House International Relations
Committee's Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, today called on the
United Nations (UN) to take the necessary steps to hold those guilty in the Oil
for Food scandal accountable and lay the groundwork for broader reform of the
body.

"The Volcker Report shows that corruption was rife within the Oil for Food
program," said Flake. "In order to get this scandal behind them and again become
an effective body, the UN needs to waive immunity for those implicated and turn
over all relevant documents to Member states."

"The House of Representatives has passed legislation that seeks to reform the UN
by conditioning a portion of U.S. funding on it. The ball in the UN's court, but
Congress is ready to act if the UN continues to stonewall."

Congressman Flake successfully authored an amendment to the UN Reform Act (H.R.
2745) that requires the UN to turn over documentary evidence to Member states
investigating the Oil for Food scandal and waive immunity for any UN employee
charged in the U.S. with a crime associated with the Oil for Food program.

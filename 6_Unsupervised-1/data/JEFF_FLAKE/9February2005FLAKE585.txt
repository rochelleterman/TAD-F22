Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, today
praised the REAL ID Act, which among other things would prevent illegal
immigrants from obtaining driver's licenses, require states to issue driver's
licenses to foreign nationals that expire no later than their visas expire, and
expedite the completion of a fence on the California-Mexico border.

"This has been played up as some kind of debate on immigration, but the truth is
that this bill is about security," said Flake. "I'm a strong supporter of
President Bush's effort to implement a comprehensive temporary worker plan, and
these are needed security measures."

"Most of the provisions of the bill are commonsense reforms, many recommended by
the 9/11 Commission, that enhance homeland security."

The provision that requires states to issue driver's licenses to foreign
nationals that expire on or before the expiration date of their visas largely
mirrors legislation first introduced by Congressman Flake in 2002.

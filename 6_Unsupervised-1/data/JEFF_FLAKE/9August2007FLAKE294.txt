Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Congressman Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District,
today praised comments by President Bush against raising the gas tax.

Rather than raising the gas tax, President Bush suggested that Congress ought to
"revisit the process by which they spend gasoline money."

Congressman Flake has announced plans to introduce legislation that will prevent
states with deficient bridges from receiving transportation earmarks that are
not directly related to transportation, such as bike paths, transportation
museums, parking lots, and road beautification projects. Many of the more than
6,000 earmarks in the most recent transportation bill, which was signed into law
in 2005, went to such projects.

"Congress doesn't need to raise taxes to pay for bridge repair; we need to stop
wasting transportation funding on pork projects," said Flake.

Under the 2005 transportation bill, a state's transportation earmarks are
subtracted from that state's transportation funding allocation, so every dollar
spent on a bike path or transportation museum is a dollar the state cannot spend
on more important transportation needs, like bridge repair.

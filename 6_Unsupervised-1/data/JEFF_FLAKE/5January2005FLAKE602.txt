Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents the state's Sixth District, today
pointed to comments from defense analysts warning Congress that its pork barrel
spending was putting troops at risk.

Defense analysts, quoted in CongressDaily, claim that defense cuts were made to
offset the nearly $9 billion earmarked by Congress.

"When Congress diverts billions of dollars to their own pet projects, it
requires the Department of Defense to make cuts in other programs, body armor
and Humvee armor included," said Flake.

"Not only is pork barrel spending bad for taxpayers, but it's actually putting
our troops at risk."

Congressman Flake has long advocated a moratorium on earmarks, the spending
items slipped into appropriations bills without appropriate congressional
oversight.

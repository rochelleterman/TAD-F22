Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District, today
announced that House conservatives reached an agreement with House Leadership on
earmark reform modeled largely on his legislation. Agreement was also reached on
other budget process reforms.

House conservatives reached an agreement with House Leadership on earmark
reform, only to have House appropriators withhold support of the budget
resolution if the earmark reform was included.

"Truth be told, the earmark reforms agreed to are pretty modest. All we're
asking for is for earmarks to be debated in the light of day. Apparently, this
was a bridge too far for appropriators," said Flake.

Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents the state's Sixth District, today
praised President Bush for submitting a budget proposal that reduces domestic
spending for fiscal year 2006.

"Given the way that spending has grown over the past several years, this is a
modest, but welcome, reduction," said Flake. "However, I'm skeptical that
appropriators in Congress share President Bush's commitment to fiscal
responsibility, so I hope he's prepared to break out his veto pen when
appropriations season rolls around."

"Congress also needs to avoid the budget gimmickry that we've proven to be so
adept at in the past."

Congressman Flake is an outspoken critic of congressional spending. He has
proposed a moratorium in earmarks, the spending items (usually in Members' home
districts) slipped into appropriations bills without appropriate congressional
oversight.

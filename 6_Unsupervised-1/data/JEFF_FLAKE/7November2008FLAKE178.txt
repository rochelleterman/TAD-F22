Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Congressman Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Senator Tom Coburn, M.D. (R-OK) have sent a
letter to President Bush requesting an executive order reforming the earmark
process.

President Bush issued an executive order in January 2008 that directed federal
agencies to disregard earmarks that had not been codified into law. However,
Congress has been able to circumvent the order through legislative manipulation.

An additional executive order issued this year will help the Obama
Administration reform the practice.

"The Republican Party's indulgence in earmarks helped decimate its ranks in
Congress and its reputation for fiscal responsibility," said Dr. Coburn. "By
strengthening his executive order against this secretive process, President Bush
will not only help the Republican Party regain its bearings, but give
President-elect Obama more tools to combat this wasteful practice. In a time of
economic turmoil the last thing members of Congress should be doing is
distracting themselves with narrow, parochial interests."

"President-elect Obama is going to be under tremendous pressure from
congressional leaders to turn a blind eye to earmarks," said Congressman Flake.
"He could really use this tool to if he wants to succeed in curbing pork."

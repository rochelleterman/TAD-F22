Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District, and Rep. John
Campbell, who represents California's Forty-eighth District, today hosted an
event to discuss how dynamic scoring could affect this year's budget and newly
implemented PAYGO rules.

"Given that tax bills are now subject to PAYGO rules, it's imperative that we
have accurate economic forecasts," said Flake.

"We're seeing record revenues right now, largely because of the Bush tax cuts,
yet the current method of scoring consistently ignores the macroeconomic impact
of tax cuts."

Congressman Flake will soon introduce legislation that would require the
Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation to use dynamic
scoring to account for the macroeconomic effects of revenue bills.

Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District, today applauded
comments made by President Bush regarding earmark reform. President Bush made
the comments at an event highlighting fiscal responsibility in Manassas,
Virginia.

In the budget proposal sent to Congress yesterday, President Bush reiterated his
request that earmarks be included in the legislative text of bills, rather than
buried in the conference reports or committee reports that accompany bills.

"Appropriators intentionally keep earmarks out of the legislative text of bills,
so they can avoid having to defend them," said Flake. "That's got to change."

"The President deserves some praise for having the guts to take on an issue like
this that will irritate the most powerful Members of Congress. I hope he'll show
them that he's serious by threatening to veto any spending bill with
unauthorized earmarks."

President Bush's earmark proposal mirrors legislation (H.R. 631) introduced by
Congressman Flake that would require that earmarks be included in the
legislative text of bills. This would subject earmarks to increased levels of
scrutiny and accountability.

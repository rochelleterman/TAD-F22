Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Congressman Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District,
today sent a letter to House Appropriations Committee David Obey urging him to
follow through on a threat he has made to eliminate earmarks in the remaining
fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills.

Chairman Obey has cautioned House Members that, if congressional appropriators
are forced to make additional spending reductions in order to meet President
Bush's spending levels, Members' earmarks will be among the first items to be
cut.

House earmarks in the remaining appropriations bills amount to at least $3.3
billion.

"While many Members of Congress might object to earmark-free spending bills this
year, my guess is that many more taxpayers would applaud such a move," said
Flake.

"House earmarks may not completely close the gap between Congress' and President
Bush's budget levels, but Chairman Obey is absolutely right that they ought to
be the first thing on the chopping block."

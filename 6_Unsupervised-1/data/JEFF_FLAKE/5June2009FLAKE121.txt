WASHINGTON, June 3 -- Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following
press release:

Republican Congressman Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District,
today expressed disappointment that the House of Representatives killed a
resolution regarding the PMA Group. The House referred to committee a privileged
resolution offered by Majority Leader Hoyer that would have required the House
Ethics Committee to disclose whether or not it has an open investigation into
the PMA Group. Because the resolution was referred to committee rather than
passed, the Ethics Committee is not required to act on it. "The privileged
resolution offered by Leader Hoyer might have had limited value had we been
allowed to vote on it," said Flake. "Unfortunately, it wasn't Leader Hoyer's
motion that was adopted. Rather, the House adopted Congressman McGovern's motion
to refer the resolution to committee, thus rendering it meaningless. What we did
today has the same effect as dropping a bill in the hopper. No further action is
required." In light of the Hoyer resolution, Congressman Flake held off on
offering his ninth privileged resolution requiring the Ethics Committee to
examine the relationship between earmarks to clients of the PMA Group and
PMA-related campaign contributions. However, he will continue to offer such
resolutions until the House severs the tie between earmarks and campaign
contributions.For more information please contact: Sarabjit Jagirdar, Email:-

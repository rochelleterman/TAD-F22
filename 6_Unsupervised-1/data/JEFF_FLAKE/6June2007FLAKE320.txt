Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District, today sent
a letter to the Office of Management and Budget Director Rob Portman regarding
the intention of House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey to put all
earmarks in conference reports.

Under the plan, earmarks would not be inserted until bills reach conference
committees. This would prevent individual earmarks from being challenged and
would delay the scrutiny of earmarks until it is too late to take action.

"Not only does slipping earmarks into conference reports negate the reforms this
Congress has made, but it signifies a huge step backwards," said Flake.

"Hopefully, the prospect of having spending bills vetoed will spur House
appropriators to play by the rules."

Last year, Congressman Flake offered 39 amendments to strike earmarks from
appropriations bills. Under the Democratic plan to drop earmarks into conference
reports, Congressman Flake would not have the ability to offer similar
amendments this year.

Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents the state's Sixth District, today
announced that he would be offering an amendment to the Deficit Reduction Act
that would rescind a portion of the earmarked spending in the mammoth $285
billion transportation bill and give states greater discretion to use the
remaining funding.

The amendment would allow states to disregard earmark instructions in the bill
and spend the money on projects they believe are of greater importance. The
amendment would also rescind 10 percent of earmarked funding in the bill to be
used to offset other spending priorities, like hurricane recovery and bird flu
preparations.

"Let's face it, as long as we're spending money on Bridges to Nowhere, trying to
portray ourselves as fiscal conservatives is like Alan Alda trying to portray
himself as a Republican on The West Wing," said Flake. "It's entertaining, but
it's not very believable."

"Taxpayers don't trust us with their money, and who can blame them as long as we
continue to defend some of the pork projects in the transportation bill."

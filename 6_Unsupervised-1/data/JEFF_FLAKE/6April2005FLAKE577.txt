Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents the state's Sixth District, today
highlighted another pork project contained in the massive omnibus spending bill
that Congress passed for fiscal year 2005.

This week's egregious earmark: $200,000 for the Brookings Harbor Seafood
Processing Plant in Oregon.

"It's ironic that taxpayers have to shell out 200,000 clams for an earmark like
this," said Flake.

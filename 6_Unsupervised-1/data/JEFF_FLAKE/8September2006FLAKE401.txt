Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District, today highlighted a
pork project contained in the Transportation-Treasury-HUD appropriations bill
for fiscal year 2006.

This week's egregious earmark: $250,000 to the Village of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico
for construction of a little league baseball park at Old Ramey Air Force Base.

"The sad truth is that all of these little league earmarks add up to major
league spending," said Flake.

Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District, today sent a letter to
House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Majority Leader John Boehner urging them to
schedule a vote on S. 2590, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency
Act.

The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act, sponsored by Senators
Coburn and Obama, would create a searchable internet database of federal
spending. The Senate passed the bill unanimously yesterday.

The House passed a similar bill in June. The House version, however, omits
federal contracts from the database.

"We have the technology to make federal spending transparent; we just need to
show taxpayers that we have the will to make it transparent," said Flake.

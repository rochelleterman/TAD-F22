WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 -- Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following
press release:

Republican Congressman Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District,
today voted against raising the federal debt limit by $1.9 trillion, which
increases the statutory debt limit to $14.294 trillion.

"President Obama's recent call for a spending freeze was an acknowledgment that
federal spending is out of control," said Flake, "but you don't control spending
by raising the debt limit."

"Unfortunately, Republicans became pretty experienced spenders during our time
in power, but Democrats are making us look like amateurs. Unless this Congress
can get a handle on spending, we'll be raising the debt limit again soon."For

Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Congressman Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District,
today testified on the STRIVE Act before the House Judiciary Committee's
Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and
International Law.

Congressman Flake, along with Congressman Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, has
introduced the STRIVE Act, which would increase border security, strengthen
interior enforcement, create a temporary worker program, and deny amnesty to
illegal immigrants.

"Americans do not share Congress' unwillingness to tackle immigration reform,"
said Flake.

"In the absence of congressional action, states and the Bush Administration have
pushed ahead on various enforcement initiatives. I don't blame them for trying
to do the job that Congress has failed to do."

"However, enforcement alone cannot solve this problem. Until Congress creates a
comprehensive temporary worker program, the success of state and Administration
measures will have a ceiling."

"Congress needs to begin work on a comprehensive immigration reform proposal,
and the STRIVE Act is an excellent place to start."

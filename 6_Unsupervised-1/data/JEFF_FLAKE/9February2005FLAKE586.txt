Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents the state's Sixth District, today
highlighted another pork project contained in the massive omnibus spending bill
that Congress passed late last year.

This week's egregious earmark: $1.5 million for a demonstration project to
transport naturally chilled water from Lake Ontario to Lake Onondaga.

"I hate to throw cold water on Congress' spending spree, but if we continue to
spend taxpayer money on earmarks like this, we're really going to water down our
majority," said Flake.

ESA, Ariz., Aug. 7 -- Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following
press release:

Republican Congressman Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District,
today criticized the Democratic healthcare plan.

"I don't think there's anyone who would argue that our healthcare system isn't
in need of reform," said Flake. "However, we need reform that enhances the
current system's advantages while addressing its soaring costs. The Democratic
healthcare plan does neither."

"Republicans have offered free market proposals that use competition to enhance
service and reduce cost. Republican proposals also include medical liability
reform, which is an essential component of controlling costs."

"The Democrats would have us believe that the only choice we have is between
their reform plan, which involves a massive shift toward more government
control, and the status quo. It doesn't have to be that way. We need to consider
Republican ideas and alternatives."For more information please contact: Sarabjit

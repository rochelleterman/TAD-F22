Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Rep. Jeff Flake, a member of the House Judiciary Committee's Immigration and
Border Security Subcommittee, today praised President Bush for reiterating his
call for a comprehensive approach to immigration reform.

"Every day the House and Senate wait to appoint members of the conference
committee is a day closer to election day, and the closer it gets to election
day, the more politically charged this issue will get," said Flake. "Reaching an
agreement isn't going to be easy, but it's only going to get harder the longer
we wait."

Congressman Flake, along with Congressmen Jim Kolbe and Luis Gutierrez, has
introduced the House version of the McCain-Kennedy immigration reform bill. The
Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act (H.R. 2330) will enhance national
security, meet U.S. labor demands, and prevent deaths at the border by creating
a comprehensive temporary worker program.

Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Congressman Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District,
today announced his committee assignments for the 111th Congress.

Congressman Flake retained his seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Congressman Flake also retained his seat on the House Committee on Natural
Resources, which has jurisdiction over many issues directly affecting Arizona,
such as water rights, public lands, and relations with Native American tribes.

Despite lobbying for a seat on the House Appropriations Committee, where he
could have a greater impact on earmark reform, Congressman Flake was named to
the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

"Naturally, I'm disappointed that I wasn't appointed to the Appropriations
Committee," said Flake. "I've long felt that the Appropriations Committee has
neglected its oversight responsibilities, and it would have been nice to do
something about it. But I'm excited about serving on the Oversight and
Government Reform Committee."

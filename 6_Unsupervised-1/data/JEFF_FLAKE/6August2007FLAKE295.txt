Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Congressman Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District,
today announced that he plans to introduce legislation that will prevent states
with deficient bridges from receiving transportation earmarks that are not
directly related to transportation, such as bike paths, transportation museums,
parking lots, and road beautification projects. Many of the more than 6,000
earmarks in the most recent transportation bill went to such projects.

"It's difficult to justify spending money on parking lots and road
beautification projects when there are clearly more vital transportation needs,"
said Flake.

Under the transportation bill passed in 2005, a state's earmarks are subtracted
from that state's funding allocation, so every dollar spent on a bike path or
transportation museum is a dollar the state cannot spend on more important
transportation needs.

TRANSPARENCY LEGISLATION INTRODUCED BY REPS. FLAKE, WEINER INCLUDED IN HOMELAND
SECURITY AUTHORIZATION

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District, today was
pleased that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) authorization bill
included legislation he has introduced with Congressman Anthony Weiner of New
York.

The provision in the DHS authorization bill mirrors the Homeland Security
Transparency Act, which Congressmen Flake and Weiner introduced in March. The
legislation requires state and local governments that receive DHS grants to file
quarterly reporters detailing how those funds have been spent.

The legislation was crafted after numerous media reports of waste and abuse of
DHS grants, such as kennels for stray animals in California, bingo halls in
Kentucky, flat screen televisions in Maryland, and bullet-proof vests for dogs
in Ohio.

While Congressman Flake did not support the DHS authorization bill because it
expands the bureaucracy at the department as well as creating several
duplicative and problematic programs, he was glad that the Homeland Security
Transparency Act was included.

"Spending money on homeland security simply for the sake of spending money on
homeland security does not make anybody safer," said Flake. "We need to make
sure that homeland security funds are being spent effectively, and disclosure is
the first step in that process."

WASHINGTON, March 4 -- Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following
press release:

Republican Congressman Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District,
today urged President Obama to veto the omnibus spending bill, which contains
over 8,500 earmarks. "It's unacceptable to simply say that this is last year's
budget," said Flake. "By signing this bill, President Obama takes on some
responsibility for these earmarks." "At the very least, President Obama needs to
outline how he plans to handle earmarks moving forward. It's inadequate to
simply set a ceiling on the number or total value of earmarks. Putting an end to
earmarks for private companies, which essentially constitute no-bid contracts,
would be a step in the right direction, at least in terms of eliminating the
corrupting nature of earmarks."For more information please contact: Sarabjit

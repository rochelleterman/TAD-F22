REP. FLAKE: SO JUST HOW BROKE ARE WE?

LENGTH: 244  words


WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 -- Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following
press release:

Republican Congressman Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District,
today illustrated the size and scope of the growing national debt.

The U.S. government has halted production of its new, technologically advanced
$100 bills due to an issue with the presses that print U.S. money.

A Yahoo! Blog post states that the flawed bills cost approximately $120 million
to print and add up to $10 billion - more than 10-percent of our total money
supply. And because the flaw cannot be repaired, the bills will now have to be
burned. If we saved the quarantined bills from fiery doom and instead put them
to use in paying off our massive $13 trillion debt, the government would have to
goof up approximately 1,300 more times before our debt would be paid off.

"We've been figuratively burning money for years, but now we're literally
burning money?" said Flake.

Along with Senator McCain, Congressman Flake introduced the Debt Buy-Down Act,
which allows taxpayers to designate up to 10 percent of their federal income tax
liability to reduce the national debt. The bill then requires Congress to reduce
federal spending by that amount.

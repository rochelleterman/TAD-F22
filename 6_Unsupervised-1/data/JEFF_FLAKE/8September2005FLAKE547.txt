Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents the state's Sixth District, today
applauded President Bush's move to temporarily suspend the Davis-Bacon Act for
the Hurricane Katrina recovery.

The Davis-Bacon Act can add weeks to federally financed construction projects
and it effectively discriminates against non-union contractors, often driving up
costs. President George H.W. Bush temporarily suspended the Davis-Bacon Act
during the recovery from Hurricane Andrew in 1992.

"The victims of this disaster deserve the swiftest and most efficient response
that the federal government can provide, so President Bush did the right thing
in temporarily suspending Davis-Bacon," said Flake.

Congressman Flake, along with Congressman Tom Feeney of Florida and
Congresswoman Marilyn Musgrave of Colorado, organized a letter sent to President
Bush yesterday asking him to make the proclamation.

Congressman Flake has also introduced legislation (H.R. 3684) that would
automatically trigger a temporary suspension of Davis-Bacon when the President
declares a state of emergency.

Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District, today
criticized the Democrats' decision to add more than $10 billion in extraneous
items to the supplemental spending bill to fund operations in Iraq.

"I hope that the Democrats reconsider their decision not to put forward a clean
Iraq spending bill," said Flake. "It's difficult to have an honest debate on
funding for the war when these unrelated items have been tacked on."

Among the add-ons is $4.3 billion in agriculture disaster relief.

"The agriculture spending is particularly offensive, given that we were told
during debate on the last farm bill that, if we increased annual subsidies,
these ad hoc agriculture disaster bills would end."

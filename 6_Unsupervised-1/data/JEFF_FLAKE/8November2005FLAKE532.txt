Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, a member of the House Judiciary Committee's
Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, today commended Immigration
Subcommittee Chairman John Hostettler for offering his own immigration reform
proposal.

Yet, Rep. Flake stressed that an "enforcement only" approach to immigration
reform will not be sufficient to solve our immigration problems.

"This latest immigration reform proposal is another sign that there is clearly a
desire in Congress to tackle this issue," said Flake.

"However, Congress needs to learn from the mistakes we've made in the past when
we've tried to reform our immigration system. An 'enforcement only' proposal is
not a solution. Enforcement is surely a critical component of reform, but it has
to be coupled with a comprehensive temporary worker program."

Congressman Flake, along with Congressmen Jim Kolbe and Luis Gutierrez and
Senators John McCain and Edward Kennedy, has introduced legislation that will
create a temporary worker program. The Secure America and Orderly Immigration
Act (H.R. 2330) will enhance national security, meet U.S. labor demands, and
prevent deaths at the border by creating a comprehensive temporary worker
program.

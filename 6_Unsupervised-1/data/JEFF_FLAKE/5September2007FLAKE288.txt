Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Congressman Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District,
today praised the testimony of Transportation Secretary Mary Peters before the
House Transportation Committee.

Secretary Peters stressed that before Congress raise taxes and spend additional
funding on infrastructure improvements, Congress needs to reexamine current
transportation spending priorities.

"There's no question that we have infrastructure needs that aren't currently
being met," said Flake. "However, those needs aren't being met because Congress
lacks the resources, but rather because Congress is mismanaging transportation
funding."

"Instead of raising taxes, Congress has a responsibility to stop spending
transportation funding on pork projects and direct that money to address the
country's infrastructure needs."

Congressman Flake is preparing legislation that would allow states with
deficient bridges to ignore earmark instructions and direct that funding to
repair bridges instead. Many of the more than 6,000 earmarks in the most recent
transportation bill were not directly related to roads and bridges, such as bike
paths, transportation museums, parking lots, and road beautification projects.

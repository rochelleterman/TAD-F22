Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Congressman Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District,
today called on Congress to alleviate the Highway Trust Fund shortfall by
rescinding transportation earmarks rather than transferring money from the
general fund.

"Congress spent more money on earmarks than there was money to pay for them,"
said Flake. "Instead of taking money from the general fund for these earmarks,
Congress needs to go on a pork diet."

Congressman Flake has authored the ROAD Act (H.R. 6534), which would help bridge
the shortfall by rescinding unspent earmark funds within SAFETEA-LU, the 2005
transportation bill. SAFETEA-LU contained over 6,000 earmarks totaling over $24
billion.

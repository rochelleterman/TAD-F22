Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, a member of the House Resources Committee, will retain
his seat on the committee's Forests and Forest Health Subcommittee.

The subcommittee will be instrumental as Arizona and other Western states brace
for another potentially ravaging fire season.

Additionally, Congressman Flake was elected Vice-Chairman of the Western Caucus,
a group of sixty Members of Congress dedicated to improving the quality of life
in rural areas through policies that promote limited government, individual
liberty, and economic opportunity.

"As Arizonans know, the risk of more catastrophic wildfires is still there,"
said Flake. "As the Forests and Forest Health Subcommittee continues to address
the threat of catastrophic wildfires in the West, it's imperative that Arizona
be fully represented."

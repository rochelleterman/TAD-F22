```

## 1. Prepare 

### 1.1 

Download and install the following packages to get started:

```{r}
library(quanteda)
library(tidyverse)
library(lsa) # you might have to install `lsa` first
```

### 1.2

In this unit we'll be analyzing a series of press releases from Jeff Flake while he was a House member from Arizona.  We already have the files preprocessed and available in `FlakeMatrix.RData`

Load that file to import the object `flake_matrix`

```{r}
# load file
load('Data/FlakeMatrix.RData')

# print the dimensions of the DTM. How many documents + words are there?
dim(flake_matrix)
```

## 2. Euclidean Distance

### 2.1 

The function `dist()` allows for calculation of distances. Check out the help file and notice the different options for the `method` argument. The default is euclidean.

```{r}
?dist
```

### 2.2 

Let's use the function to calculate the euclidean distance between the documents.

```{r}
euclid.dist <- dist(flake_matrix, method = "euclidean")
```

### 2.3 

This creates an object of class `distance`. You can convert it to a matrix with:

```{r}
euclid.dist <- as.matrix(euclid.dist)
```

### 2.4

Find the dimensions of the matrix. Why does it have these dimensions? What does each cell represent?

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

### 2.5 

For each press release, we want to identify another press release that is "closest" (smallest distance).

Instead of using for-loops, let's try vectorized code with the `map` family of functions. (Vectorized code is faster and tends to be preferred over for-loops in the R community.)

First, create a function that passes the index of a document, and returns the index of the document that is closest to it (other than the document itself).

```{r}
get.closest <- function(matrix, index){
   row <- matrix[index,]
   closest <- order(row)[2]
   return(closest)
}

# test the function (you should get "313")
get.closest(euclid.dist, 1)
```

### 2.6

Look up the help page for the `map` function. Using this function, calculate the closest document for each email.

```{r}
?map

indices <- 1:nrow(euclid.dist)
map_dbl(indices, get.closest, matrix = euclid.dist)
```

## 3 Cosine Similarity

If we want to use a measure of distance that takes into consideration the length of the press releases, we can calculate the cosine similarity by using the `cosine` function from the `lsa` package.

### 3.1 

Unlike the `dist` function which compares distances between rows, the `cosine` function compares distances between columns. This means that we have the **transpose** our matrix before passing it into the `cosine` function.

**Warning!** The code below might take a minute or two to run.

```{r}
# transpose matrix
flake_matrix_t <- t(flake_matrix)

# calculate cosine metric
cos.sim <- cosine(flake_matrix_t)
```

### 3.2

Keep in mind that cosine similarity is a measure of similarity (rather than distance) that ranges between 0 and 1 (as it is the cosine of the angle between the two vectors). In order to get a measure of distance (or dissimilarity), we need to "flip" the measure so that a larger angle receives a larger value. The distance measure derived from cosine similarity is therefore one minus the cosine similarity between two vectors.

```{r}
# convert to dissimilarity distances
cos.dist <- as.matrix(1-cos.sim) 
```

### 3.3

Using the techniques you learned above, use `map` to calculate the most similar document for each email.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

## 4. Visualizing distance with MDS

It is often desirable to visualize the pairwise distances between our texts. A general approach to visualizing distances is to assign a point in a plane to each text, making sure that the distance between points is proportional to the pairwise distances we calculated. This kind of visualization is common enough that it has a name, ["multidimensional scaling"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling) (MDS).

### 4.1 

Run the code below to see how it works. Which documents are unusual according to this visualization? Using `rowSums` on the `flake_matrix`, find out how long the unusual documents are.

```{r}
# fit the scale
fit <- cmdscale(euclid.dist, eig=TRUE, k=2) # k is the number of dim

# plot solution 
x <- fit$points[,1]
y <- fit$points[,2]
plot(x, y, xlab="Coordinate 1", ylab="Coordinate 2", 
  main="Metric	MDS",	type="n")
text(x, y, labels = 1:nrow(flake_matrix), cex=.7)

# find the average length of the documents
mean(rowSums(flake_matrix))

# now look the length of the outliers
rowSums(flake_matrix)[45]
rowSums(flake_matrix)[150]
```

### 4.2

Now edit the code above to visualize the documents according to the cosine metric. Why do you think the visualizations differ so much?

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```
